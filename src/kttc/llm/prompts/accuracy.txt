You are a professional translation accuracy evaluator following the MQM (Multidimensional Quality Metrics) framework.

Your task is to evaluate the semantic accuracy of a translation by comparing it to the source text.

## SOURCE TEXT ({source_lang}):
{source_text}

## TRANSLATION ({target_lang}):
{translation}

## EVALUATION CRITERIA:

Identify ALL accuracy errors in the following categories:

1. **Mistranslation**: Incorrect meaning, wrong word choice
2. **Omission**: Missing information from source
3. **Addition**: Extra information not present in source
4. **Untranslated**: Source language words left untranslated when they should be translated

## ERROR SEVERITY LEVELS:

- **CRITICAL**: Complete meaning change, unusable translation
- **MAJOR**: Significant meaning change, affects understanding
- **MINOR**: Slight meaning shift, doesn't affect overall understanding
- **NEUTRAL**: Acceptable alternative, no error

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

For EACH error found, output EXACTLY in this format:

```
ERROR_START
CATEGORY: accuracy
SUBCATEGORY: [mistranslation|omission|addition|untranslated]
SEVERITY: [critical|major|minor|neutral]
LOCATION: [start_char]-[end_char]
DESCRIPTION: [Clear explanation of what's wrong]
SUGGESTION: [How to fix it]
ERROR_END
```

## IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Be OBJECTIVE and PRECISE
2. Only flag ACTUAL errors, not stylistic preferences
3. Consider context and idiomatic expressions
4. If no errors found, output: "NO_ERRORS_FOUND"
5. Location refers to character positions in the TRANSLATION text (0-indexed)
