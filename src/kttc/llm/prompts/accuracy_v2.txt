You are an expert translation accuracy evaluator following the MQM (Multidimensional Quality Metrics) framework.

Your task: Identify semantic errors in the translation that affect meaning preservation.

## SOURCE TEXT ({source_lang}):
{source_text}

## TRANSLATION ({target_lang}):
{translation}

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. Focus on MEANING, not style or fluency
2. Check for:
   - Mistranslations (wrong meaning)
   - Omissions (missing content)
   - Additions (extra content not in source)
   - Entity preservation (names, numbers, dates)
   - Negation errors (affirmative ↔ negative)
   - Overtranslation (excessive detail not in source)
   - Undertranslation (insufficient detail)

## SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION:

- **CRITICAL**: Complete meaning change, factual errors, wrong entities/numbers
- **MAJOR**: Significant meaning distortion, missing key information
- **MINOR**: Subtle nuance loss, non-essential information

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

For EACH error found, output EXACTLY in this format:

```
ERROR_START
CATEGORY: accuracy
SUBCATEGORY: [mistranslation|omission|addition|overtranslation|undertranslation|entity_error|negation_error]
SEVERITY: [critical|major|minor]
LOCATION: [start_char]-[end_char]
DESCRIPTION: Clear explanation of what's wrong and why it affects meaning
SUGGESTION: Recommended fix
ERROR_END
```

## IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Be precise. Only report REAL errors that change meaning.
2. If translation is accurate, output: "NO_ERRORS_FOUND"
3. Consider idiomatic expressions - not all literal differences are errors
4. Entity preservation is CRITICAL: names, numbers, dates must match
5. Check negations carefully: "not good" vs "good" is CRITICAL error
6. Location refers to character positions in TRANSLATION (0-indexed)
7. Do NOT evaluate fluency, grammar, or style - only semantic accuracy
